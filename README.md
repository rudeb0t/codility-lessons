# Codility Lessons

These are my solutions to the lessons in Codility. You can find them here:

https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons

In most cases, I try to write the solutions so that they use the algorithm(s)
presented in the lessons.  All of these solutions will score 100%, but
sometimes I use some shortcut methods and "cheat" using built-in Python
functions. Especially in lesson 6, I am too lazy to write these sorting
algorithms in Python and they will perform quite poorly compared to the
built-ins which are implemented in C anyway. I prefer to use the obvious
Pythonic solution. However, because codility does not reveal the inputs and the
full test suites until you submit your code, there are times when the Pythonic
solution performs poorly. In cases where the Pythonic solution is slower, I
will use a more verbose solution which often trades off space for time.

Also included in each solution is a test suite which can be run using pytest.
Some suites only contain the example inputs given in the problem. That's
because I got the solution in one go :) However some solutions have multiple
test suites as a result of multiple tries to get 100%

This is a work in progress, as I go through all the lessons in my spare time.
